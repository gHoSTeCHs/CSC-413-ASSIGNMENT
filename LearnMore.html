				<h2>What is Menstruation?</h2>
				<p>
					Menstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that occurs as
					part of a woman's monthly cycle. Every month, your body prepares for
					pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, the uterus, or womb, sheds its
					lining. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from
					inside the uterus.
				</p>
				<h2>What happens at menstruation?</h2>
				<p>
					Menstruation is a woman's monthly bleeding, often called your
					“period.” When you menstruate, your body discards the monthly buildup
					of the lining of your uterus (womb). Menstrual blood and tissue flow
					from your uterus through the small opening in your cervix and pass out
					of your body through your vagina
				</p>
				<h2>How many days is a normal period last?</h2>
				<p>
					Periods last around 2 to 7 days, and women lose about 20 to 90ml
					(about 1 to 5 tablespoons) of blood in a period. Some women bleed more
					heavily than this, but help is available if heavy periods are a
					problem.
				</p>
				<h2>Can a woman get pregnant during menstruation?</h2>
				<p>
					If you have sex without using contraception, you can conceive (get
					pregnant) at any time during your menstrual cycle, even during or just
					after your period. You can also get pregnant if you have never had a
					period before, during your first period, or after the first time you
					have sex.
				</p>
				<h2>How do you know if your period is healthy?</h2>
				<p>
					A healthy period starts with 3-7 days of solid flow, followed by a
					couple of days of lighter bleeding. There should be no bleeding at any
					other time of the cycle
				</p>
				<h2>Can your period date change every month?</h2>
				<p>
					Your period date changing every month is not as uncommon as you think
					it is. Period dates vary. You're likely not going to get your period
					on the same date as the previous one due to changes in menstrual
					cycle, which ranges from 21-35 days.
				</p>
				<h2>Which Colour of period is healthy?</h2>
				<p>
					Healthy period blood typically varies from bright red to dark brown or
					black. Blood or discharge that is orange or grey may indicate an
					infection. Women who experience bleeding during pregnancy should see a
					doctor or obstetrician for an evaluation.

				<h2 class="ovulationStage">Stages of the Menstrual Cycle</h2>
				<h2>Menstrual phase</h2>
				<p>
					The menstrual phase is the first stage of the menstrual cycle. It’s
					also when you get your period.<br />

					This phase starts when an egg from the previous cycle isn’t
					fertilized. Because pregnancy hasn’t taken place, levels of the
					hormones estrogen and progesterone drop. <br />

					The thickened lining of your uterus, which would support a pregnancy,
					is no longer needed, so it sheds through your vagina. During your
					period, you release a combination of blood, mucus, and tissue from
					your uterus. <br>
          You may have period symptoms like these:
          <ul class="mestrualSymptoms">
            <div class="container">
              <li class="mens">Cramps</li>
            <li class="mens">Tender breasts</li>
            <li class="mens">Bloating</li>
            <li class="mens">Mood Swings</li>
            <li class="mens">Irritability</li>
            <li class="mens">Headaches</li>
            <li class="mens">Tiredness</li>
            <li class="mens">Low back pain</li>
            </div>

          </ul>
				</p>
        <h2>Follicular phase</h2>
        <p>
          The follicular phase starts on the first day of your period (so there is some overlap with the menstrual phase) and ends when you ovulate. 
<br>
          It starts when the hypothalamus signals your pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This hormone stimulates your ovaries to produce around 5 to 20 small sacs called follicles. Each follicle contains an immature egg.
<br>
          Only the healthiest egg will eventually mature. (On rare occasions, a female may have two eggs mature.) The rest of the follicles will be reabsorbed into your body.
<br>
          The maturing follicle sets off a surge in estrogen that thickens the lining of your uterus. This creates a nutrient-rich environment for an embryo to grow.
<br>
          The average follicular phaseTrusted Source lasts for about 16 days. It can range from 11 to 27 days, depending on your cycle.
        </p>
        <h2>Ovulation phase</h2>
        <p>
          Rising estrogen levels during the follicular phase trigger your pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH). This is what starts the process of ovulation. <br>

          Ovulation is when your ovary releases a mature egg. The egg travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus to be fertilized by sperm. <br>

          The ovulation phase is the time during your menstrual cycle when you can get pregnant. You can tell that you’re ovulating by symptoms like these: <br>
          <ul class="mestrualSymptoms">
            <div class="container">
              <li class="mens"> slight rise in basal body temperature</li>
            <li class="mens">
              thicker discharge that has the texture of egg whites
            </li>
            
            </div>

          </ul><br>
          Ovulation happens around day 14 if you have a 28-day cycle — right in the middle of your menstrual cycle. It lasts about 24 hours. After a day, the egg will die or dissolve if it isn’t fertilized.
        </p>
        <h2>Luteal phase</h2>
        <p>
          After the follicle releases its egg, it changes into the corpus luteum. This structure releases hormones, mainly progesterone and some estrogen. The rise in hormones keeps your uterine lining thick and ready for a fertilized egg to implant. <br>
          
          If you do get pregnant, your body will produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This is the hormone pregnancy tests detect. It helps maintain the corpus luteum and keeps the uterine lining thick. <br>
          
          If you don’t get pregnant, the corpus luteum will shrink away and be resorbed. This leads to decreased levels of estrogen and progesterone, which causes the onset of your period. The uterine lining will shed during your period. <br>
          
          During this phase, if you don’t get pregnant, you may experience symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These include: <br>
          <ul class="mestrualSymptoms">
            <div class="container">
              <li class="mens">Bloating</li>
            <li class="mens">Breast swelling, pain, or tenderness</li>
            <li class="mens">Mood changes</li>
            <li class="mens">Headache</li>
            <li class="mens">Weight gain</li>
            <li class="mens">Changes in sexual desire</li>
            <li class="mens">Food cravings</li>
            <li class="mens">Trouble sleeping</li>
            </div>

          </ul><br>
          The luteal phase lasts for 11 to 17 days. The average lengthTrusted Source is 14 days.
